# Stain: tools for IxD experimentation in jQuery
## v0.0

Stain is a toolkit for rapid prototyping and experimentation in the browser.

### Tools

#### JavaScript functions

* `$.assert()` helps with testing assumptions
* `$.tweak()` makes things draggable
* `$([]).preload()` is an image preload script
* `$.getPublicMethods()` dumps the top-level methods of an object

And `console.js` makes it safe to reference the browser's console,
even in browsers without native console support.

#### CSS files

* `stain.css` defines a CSS style useful for highlighting DOM elements
